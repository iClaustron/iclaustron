iClaustron is a tool package designed to enable non-DBMS applications to take advantage
of the features developed for NDB Cluster. It features an API to connect applications
to the NDB kernel nodes. It contains an implementation of a cluster server. The cluster
server manages configuration of many clusters. It implements a number of management
functions for the cluster. The cluster client tool is a command driven tool that acts
as an interface for end-users to manage the cluster. A graphical tool to manage the
clusters would use the cluster client as interface or could have a cluster client
integrated. The replication server is used to handle parallel replication from one
cluster to another cluster. 

Description of directories
--------------------------
cclient:
This is the cluster client directory. It uses the API to the Cluster
Server to implement management features as directed by the user. The
user issues commands that are handled by a command parser. The command
parser takes care of understanding the user objectives and then there is
a set of programs to implement those features using the Cluster Server
API.

clusterserver:
Implements the Cluster Server. It is controlled by issuing commands using
the Cluster Server API and performs its action by using the API to the
Data Servers. It controls a set of clusters where each such cluster has
a configuration file that directs its start-up features. The Cluster Server
controls changes to configuration and handles failures of a Cluster Server
and failover to another Cluster Server. The Cluster Server uses an active-
passive configuration but all changes to a configuration is written to all
alive nodes before actually being changed.

api_clusterserver:
This is the C API to the Cluster Server. It is used by any application that
need to interact with the Cluster Server.

api_dataserver:
This is the C API to the Data Servers. The data servers are the storage nodes
in NDB Cluster. In iClaustron those are called Data Servers. Any application
that uses the Data Server to store data needs to use this API to implement
its functionality.

repserver:
This is the Replication Server, this server receives information about changes
from the Data Servers and implements functions to replicate those changes to
another cluster. It is only used for asynchronous replication. Synchronous
replication is handled between the Data Servers.

control:
The Control Server is an aid to ensure that the Cluster Client also can control
start and stop of iClaustron processes. It is also used to handle some support
functions, such as emailing trace files to a Support Center.

fileserver:
This is an Application Server that implements the client part of the iClaustron
Filesystem. This is a clustered filesystem that is implemented using FUSE,
a filesystem in userspace. FUSE can be used on Linux and FreeBSD.

comm:
This implements common functions to implement Communication Functions. It uses
currently IPv4 sockets. However many cluster interconnects implement socket
APIs that bypass the TCP/IP stack.

port:
This is a portability library for iClaustron. In addition to this library,
iClaustron uses glib for many common functions.
