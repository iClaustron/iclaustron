iClaustron is a tool package designed to enable non-DBMS applications to take
advantage of the features developed for NDB Cluster. It features an API to
connect applications to the NDB Data Servers. It contains an implementation of
a Cluster Server. The Cluster Server manages configuration of many
clusters. It also has an external interface that enables on-line changes to the
configuration even in the presence of many Cluster Servers.

The Cluster Manager is a server that handles management commands. It implements
a number of management functions for the cluster. These are implemented either
directly towards the Data Servers and/or by interacting with the Cluster
Servers.

The Cluster Client tool is a command driven tool that acts as an interface for
end-users to manage the cluster.

A graphical tool to manage the clusters would use the Cluster Client as
interface or could have a Cluster Client integrated.

The Replication Server is used to handle parallel replication from one cluster
to another cluster. 

Description of directories
--------------------------
cluster_server:
Implements the iClaustron Cluster Server. A configuration can contain
one or several clusters. Each cluster is maintained in one configuration file.
New clusters can be added on-line and there is an interface to change
the configurations.

cclient:
This is the Cluster Client directory. It uses the API to the Cluster
Manager to implement management features as directed by the user. The
user issues commands that are handled by a command parser. The command
parser takes care of understanding the user objectives and then there is
a set of functions to implement those features using the NDB API Protocol
and the protocol towards the iClaustron Cluster Server.

cluster_mgr:
Implements the Cluster Manager. It is controlled by issuing commands using
the Cluster Manager API and performs its action by using the API to the
Data Servers. It controls a set of clusters where each such cluster has
a configuration file that directs its start-up features. The Cluster Manager
controls changes to configuration and handles failures of a Cluster Manager
and failover to another Cluster Manager. The Cluster Manager uses an active-
passive configuration but all changes to a configuration is written to all
alive nodes before actually being changed.

api_clusterserver:
This is the C API to the Cluster Server. It is used by any application that
need to interact with the Cluster Server.

api_dataserver:
This is the C API to the Data Servers. The data servers are the storage nodes
in NDB Cluster. In iClaustron those are called Data Servers. Any application
that uses the Data Server to store data needs to use this API to implement
its functionality.

repserver:
This is the Replication Server, this server receives information about changes
from the Data Servers and implements functions to replicate those changes to
another cluster. It is only used for asynchronous replication. Synchronous
replication is handled between the Data Servers.

pcntrl:
The Control Server is an aid to ensure that the Cluster Client also can control
start and stop of iClaustron processes. It is also used to handle some support
functions, such as emailing trace files to a Support Center.

fileserver:
This is an Application Server that implements the client part of the iClaustron
Filesystem. This is a clustered filesystem that is implemented using FUSE,
a filesystem in userspace. FUSE can be used on Linux and FreeBSD. This process
uses the C API to the Data Servers to store the file data in NDB Cluster.

comm:
This implements common functions to implement Communication Functions. It uses
currently IPv4 and IPv6 sockets. However many cluster interconnects implement
socket APIs that bypass the TCP/IP stack. It also supports SSL connections.

port:
This is a portability library for iClaustron. In addition to this library,
iClaustron uses glib for many common functions.
