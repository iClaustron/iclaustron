The main part of the iClaustron program which requires bootstrap is the
Cluster Servers.

The first step in setting up an iClaustron Grid is always to write up the
initial configuration files. This can be done by hand or by using a tool
someone developed for this purpose.

The next step is how to start the iClaustron Cluster Servers the very
first time.

The recommended manner is to use the bootstrap method. It is also possible
to use a normal file copy method. We will describe both methods here.

Step 1: Install the iClaustron software package on each computer (virtual
machine) which is part of the iClaustron Grid. The software should be
installed by the same user as is used to run the iClaustron programs.
If this is the root user then the software is installed at
/usr/local/iclaustron. If the iClaustron version is iclaustron-0.0.1 the
software will be installed at
/usr/local/iclaustron_install/iclaustron-0.0.1
If it's not a root user the software will be installed at
$HOME/iclaustron_install/iclaustron-0.0.1

It's perfectly ok to have multiple iClaustron versions installed at the
same time. It would even be normal as part of a software upgrade of a
running iClaustron Grid.

As part of installing the iClaustron a service will be created that ensures
that the iClaustron process controller runs also after a restart of the
computer (virtual machine).

Step 2: Write initial configuration files.

Step 1 and 2 can be done in any order.

This step requires writing at least 3 configuration files.
The first file is always called config.ini, an example of this file is
found in examples/config.ini. This file is needed in all nodes of the
iClaustron Grid. This file contains the set of clusters that can be
accessed from this node. Naturally for nodes containing iClaustron Cluster
Servers all clusters need to be present in this file.

The config.ini contains a list of clusters with their id, name and
password. The password is use to authenticate that the program accessing
the iClaustron API have authority to do this. This means that the iClaustron
Grid administrator can decide that a certain node in the Grid only have
access to a subset of the Clusters inside the Grid.

The next file to write up is the grid_common.ini file. This file contains
the nodes which are present in all clusters in the grid, these are the
Cluster Servers and the Cluster Managers. There cannot be more than 4
Clusters Servers. There is no limit on the number of Cluster Managers.
However each cluster can have only 255 nodes and each Cluster Server and
Cluster Manager have the same node id in all the clusters of the grid.
Thus we define these nodes in a separate file. The node ids used in this
file cannot be reused for any other node.

Finally one need to write one cluster configuration file per cluster. This
file is called cluster_name.ini where cluster_name is the actual name of
the cluster. There is no specific limit to the number of clusters in the
iClaustron Grid at the moment. This file defines the configuration of the
Data Nodes, the File Server nodes, the Replication Server nodes and any
other client programs that are developed in the future.

The next step is dependent on the method used. We will start by describing
the bootstrap method.

Step 3: Install the configuration files on one of the Cluster Servers nodes.
All the files written in step 1 now needs to be installed in its proper
location. It is only necessary to install the files in one of the Cluster
Server nodes. The files should be installed as follows:
config.ini should be installed in
$HOME/iclaustron_data/config/config.ini
AND
$HOME/iclaustron_data/config/node1/config.ini
assuming the node id of the Cluster Server is 1.
The grid_common.ini is installed in
$HOME/iclaustron_data/config/node1/grid_common.ini
Then the cluster configuration files (e.g. kalle.ini and jocke.ini
as used in the examples directory) is placed in
$HOME/iclaustron_data/config/node1/kalle.ini
AND
$HOME/iclaustron_data/config/node1/jocke.ini
