max_number_of_trace_files:
Each time the kernel node crashes an entry in the error log is
produced and a trace file is produced. There is a preset number
of entries in an error log and the number of trace files also
is preset. 

number_of_replicas:
Replicas are grouped in node groups in the iClaustron Kernel.
Within a node group all nodes contain the same amount of data
and records are stored in all nodes in a node group.
