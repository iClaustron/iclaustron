Mutexes in iClaustron API code:
-------------------------------
In this document we try to cover what variables are protected by the
various mutexes. We give each mutex an ordering level. One should
never lock a mutex of a higher ordering level than any of the mutexes
already held.

IC_INT_APID_GLOBAL::mutex:
Protected variables:
Mutex ordering level: 2

IC_NDB_RECEIVE_STATE::mutex
Protected variables

Mutex ordering level: 4

IC_SEND_NODE_CONNECTION::mutex
Protected variables

Mutex ordering level: 6
