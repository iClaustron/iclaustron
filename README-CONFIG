Whenever a process in iClaustron is started it needs to find the
directory where configuration files are stored, where binaries
are stored and where it is supposed to store its data.

The default is to store configuration files in
ICLAUSTRON_DATA_DIR/config
The default is to store binaries in
ICLAUSTRON_INSTALL_DIR/iclaustron-version-number
using the directories bin, include and lib
As an example thus for version 0.0.1 it will be stored in
ICLAUSTRON_INSTALL_DIR/iclaustron-0.0.1
The MySQL installation is expected to be found in
ICLAUSTRON_INSTALL_DIR/mysql-version-number
mainly using the directory bin where ndbd is placed,
as an example using version 5.1.24-ndb-6.3.16 it will
be placed in ICLAUSTRON_INSTALL_DIR/mysql-5.1.24-ndb-6.3.16
iClaustron is mainly targeted for use with a MySQL Cluster
Carrier Grade Edition, there will most likely be some requirements
on which version is compatible with a certain iClaustron version.

Data for binaries are stored by default in ICLAUSTRON_DATA_DIR.
However the data for the ndbd binary is stored as specified in
the configuration file. It's recommended however to use
ICLAUSTRON_DATA_DIR/ndb as the place to store these files.

If the user doesn't supply the ICLAUSTRON_INSTALL_DIR (--base_dir) then
the default selection is $HOME/iclaustron_install except when running as
root or lroot when it is /var/lib/iclaustron_install.

Similarly for ICLAUSTRON_DATA_DIR (--data_dir) when it isn't supplied it
is by default selected to be in $HOME/iclaustron_data and for root and
lroot users in /var/lib/iclaustron_data.

In ICLAUSTRON_DATA_DIR/config one always expects to find a cluster
configuration file. This should always be named config.ini. It should
contain a section for each cluster the process is to connect to (for the
cluster server it should contain a section for all clusters in this grid).

Each section contains a name, id and a password for each cluster.
The password needs to be the same password as in the cluster server
otherwise the process won't be able to connect to the cluster.

This means that the config.ini file should also be placed without read
privileges to anyone else than the user using the file. It's an important
part of security to ensure this file is protected on all nodes in the
cluster.

Example of a config.ini file is provided in examples/config.ini where two
clusters kalle and jocke are used.

In the cluster server there needs to be one configuration file per cluster
also in the ICLAUSTRON_DATA_DIR/config directory. This provides the
full configuration of each cluster except for its name, id and password.
The examples directory contains examples of a kalle-cluster and a
jocke-cluster. These files are always named cluster_name.ini, thus in the
example case kalle.ini and jocke.ini.

All configuration parameters and some elementary documentation of them
can be obtained by running
./test_comm --test_type 6
For only data server config parameters use 2, for clients 3, for cluster
server 4 and for communication parameters use 5, 6 means all are printed.
